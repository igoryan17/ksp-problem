## ****KSP problem challenge****

Implementation of first k shortest paths in graph algorithms, adapted for multi graphs.
Such algorithms solve problem of multi routing in computer networks.

Application simulate network topology changing (discovering) and perform benchmarks for the chosen algorithm.
